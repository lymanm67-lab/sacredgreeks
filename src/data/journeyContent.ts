    theme: "Finding Peace in the Tension",
    scripture: "Romans 14:5-6",
    scriptureText: "One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind.",
    reading: "Tonight, as you scroll through another denouncement video, remember this: the tension you feel is real, but it doesn't have to define you. Thousands of Christian Greeks are navigating the same waters—loving Jesus deeply while cherishing their letters. The P.R.O.O.F. framework offers a path forward that honors both your faith and your fraternity or sorority experience. This journey will help you think biblically, respond graciously, and walk confidently.",
    reflection: [
      "What specific tension do you feel between your faith and Greek life?",
      "Have you felt alone in this struggle? Why or why not?",
      "What would it look like to walk in peace about this decision?"

    title: "Understanding the Accusations",
    theme: "Facing Criticism with Clarity",
    scripture: "Proverbs 18:17",
    scriptureText: "In a lawsuit the first to speak seems right, until someone comes forward and cross-examines.",
    reading: "Before we can respond to accusations, we must understand them. Critics often claim that Black Greek Letter Organizations are 'rooted in paganism,' 'demonic,' or 'incompatible with Christianity.' These claims deserve examination—not dismissal, but careful, biblical scrutiny. Today we begin building a framework for evaluating these claims with wisdom rather than fear.",
    reflection: [
      "What specific accusations have you heard about Greek life and Christianity?",
      "How have these accusations affected your peace or relationships?",
      "What does it mean to examine claims carefully rather than react emotionally?"

    title: "The P.R.O.O.F. Framework Introduction",
    theme: "A Biblical Method for Evaluation",
    scripture: "2 Timothy 2:15",
    scriptureText: "Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.",
    reading: "P.R.O.O.F. stands for: Prove all things biblically, Recognize historical context, Observe personal conviction, Operate in grace, and Focus on fruit. This framework helps us evaluate Greek life—and any tradition—through a biblical lens rather than through fear or cultural pressure. Over the coming days, we'll explore each element in depth.",
    reflection: [
      "Why is having a framework important when evaluating traditions?",
      "Which element of P.R.O.O.F. resonates most with you right now?",

    theme: "Scripture as Our Foundation",
    scripture: "1 Thessalonians 5:21",
    scriptureText: "but test them all; hold on to what is good.",
    reading: "The first element of P.R.O.O.F. calls us to test all claims against Scripture. This means we don't simply accept accusations because they sound spiritual, nor do we dismiss the Bible's clear commands. We examine what Scripture actually says about idolatry, associations, and fellowship—and what it doesn't say about cultural organizations.",
    reflection: [
      "When have you accepted a spiritual claim without examining Scripture?",
      "What does the Bible actually say about participating in cultural organizations?",
      "How can you develop a habit of testing claims against Scripture?"

    title: "Prove All Things Biblically (Part 2)",
    theme: "What Scripture Says About Idolatry",
    scripture: "1 Corinthians 8:4-6",
    scriptureText: "So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that 'An idol is nothing at all in the world' and that 'There is no God but one.'",
    reading: "Paul's teaching on meat sacrificed to idols is crucial for understanding how Christians interact with things that have 'pagan origins.' Paul doesn't say avoid all meat from pagan temples. Instead, he focuses on heart posture, personal conviction, and love for others. This principle applies to how we evaluate Greek organizations.",
    reflection: [
      "How does Paul's teaching about meat sacrificed to idols apply to Greek life?",
      "What makes something truly idolatrous versus having historical connections to other religions?",
      "Where is your heart when you participate in Greek activities?"
    ],
    prayer: "Father, purify my heart. Help me worship You alone while walking in wisdom about cultural practices. Amen."

    day: 6,
    title: "Recognize Historical Context",
    theme: "Understanding Origins Doesn't Mean Endorsing Them",
    scripture: "Romans 14:14",
    scriptureText: "I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean.",
    reading: "Many things in our culture have 'pagan origins'—wedding rings, days of the week, birthday celebrations, even some Christmas traditions. Yet Scripture teaches that origins alone don't make something sinful. Context matters. How we use something matters. What we believe about it matters.",
    reflection: [
      "What common practices in your life have historical connections to other religions?",
      "Does having historical origins in paganism automatically make something sinful?",
      "How should Christians think about cultural practices with complex histories?"
    ],
    prayer: "Lord, give me wisdom to understand history without being bound by it. Help me focus on present meaning and heart posture. Amen."

    day: 7,
    title: "Week One Reflection",
    theme: "Taking Stock of Your Journey",
    scripture: "Psalm 139:23-24",
    scriptureText: "Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.",
    reading: "You've completed your first week. Take time today to review what you've learned about the tensions, the accusations, and the beginning of the P.R.O.O.F. framework. Consider how these truths are already changing how you think about your faith and Greek life.",
    reflection: [
      "What has been the most impactful insight from this week?",
      "How has your perspective on the faith/Greek life tension shifted?",
      "What questions do you still have?"

  {
    day: 8,
    title: "Observe Personal Conviction",
    theme: "The Role of Conscience",
    scripture: "Romans 14:22-23",
    scriptureText: "So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves. But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.",
    reading: "Personal conviction matters. If you can participate in Greek life with a clear conscience before God, that's significant. If you cannot, that's equally significant. The key is to be 'fully convinced in your own mind' after careful study—not swayed by social pressure in either direction.",
    reflection: [
      "Can you participate in your organization with a clear conscience?",
      "Have you been pressured to feel guilty when you shouldn't, or comfortable when you shouldn't be?",
      "What does it mean to be 'fully convinced in your own mind'?"
    ],
    prayer: "Father, help me discern between genuine conviction from Your Spirit and false guilt from human pressure. Amen."

  {
    day: 9,
    title: "Operate in Grace",
    theme: "Disagreeing Without Division",
    scripture: "Romans 14:1-4",
    scriptureText: "Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters... Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall.",
    reading: "Christians will disagree about Greek life. Some will believe participation is fine; others will believe it's not. Operating in grace means refusing to condemn those who reach different conclusions. It means recognizing that this is a 'disputable matter' where faithful Christians can disagree.",
    reflection: [
      "How have you treated Christians who disagree with you about Greek life?",
      "What does it look like to accept others without 'quarreling over disputable matters'?",
      "Can you disagree with someone's conclusion while still respecting their faith?"
    ],
    prayer: "Lord, fill me with grace for those who see things differently. Help me major on the majors and extend freedom on secondary matters. Amen."

  {
    day: 10,
    title: "Focus on Fruit",
    theme: "Evaluating by Results",
    scripture: "Matthew 7:16-20",
    scriptureText: "By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.",
    reading: "Jesus taught us to evaluate things by their fruit. What fruit has your Greek organization produced in your life? Service? Scholarship? Community? Brotherhood or sisterhood? Leadership development? Or has it led you away from Christ? This honest evaluation is crucial.",
    reflection: [
      "What positive fruit has your Greek involvement produced?",
      "Has any aspect of Greek life led you away from Christ?",
      "How can you maximize the good fruit while addressing any concerns?"
    ],
    prayer: "Father, help me honestly evaluate the fruit in my life. Give me courage to address anything that isn't bearing good fruit. Amen."

    day: 11,
    title: "Addressing 'Pagan Origins' Arguments",
    theme: "The Genetic Fallacy",
    scripture: "Acts 17:28",
    scriptureText: "For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.'",
    reading: "Notice that Paul quotes pagan poets positively in his sermon. He doesn't reject truth simply because it came from a pagan source. This illustrates the 'genetic fallacy'—the error of rejecting something solely based on its origin rather than its current meaning and use.",
    reflection: [
      "Why might Paul quote pagan poets in a sermon about God?",
      "What is the genetic fallacy and why is it problematic?",
      "How does this apply to arguments about Greek organizations?"
    ],
    prayer: "Lord, help me think clearly and biblically. Protect me from logical fallacies that lead me away from truth. Amen."

    day: 12,
    title: "The 'Equally Yoked' Question",
    theme: "Understanding 2 Corinthians 6:14",
    scripture: "2 Corinthians 6:14",
    scriptureText: "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?",
    reading: "Critics often cite this verse against Greek involvement. But context matters. Paul is addressing spiritual partnerships that compromise faith—not all associations with non-Christians. Jesus Himself ate with sinners. Being 'in the world but not of it' requires wisdom, not isolation.",
    reflection: [
      "What kind of 'yoking' is Paul warning against in this passage?",
      "Is belonging to an organization the same as being spiritually yoked?",
      "How do you maintain your Christian witness in diverse environments?"
    ],
    prayer: "Father, help me understand Your Word in context. Show me how to be salt and light wherever I am. Amen."

    title: "Responding to Family Concerns",
    theme: "Honoring Parents While Walking in Conviction",
    scripture: "Ephesians 6:1-3",
    scriptureText: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother'—which is the first commandment with a promise.",
    reading: "What happens when your family opposes your Greek involvement? Honoring parents is biblical, but so is following your own Spirit-led convictions as an adult. The key is respect, patience, and clear communication—not defensiveness or dismissiveness.",
    reflection: [
      "How have your family members responded to your Greek involvement?",
      "What does it look like to honor parents while also following your own convictions?",
      "How can you communicate your perspective with love and respect?"
    ],
    prayer: "Lord, give me wisdom in family relationships. Help me honor my parents while walking in the convictions You've given me. Amen."

    scripture: "Colossians 2:6-7",
    scriptureText: "So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.",
    reading: "Halfway through! This week you've explored each element of P.R.O.O.F. and begun applying it to specific arguments. Your foundation is growing stronger. Continue building on what you've learned.",
    reflection: [
      "Which element of P.R.O.O.F. has been most helpful so far?",
      "What arguments are you now better equipped to address?",
      "Where do you still need growth or clarity?"

    day: 15,
    title: "Navigating Church Leadership Concerns",
    theme: "When Your Pastor Disagrees",
    scripture: "Hebrews 13:17",
    scriptureText: "Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account.",
    reading: "Respecting church leadership is important, but pastors are not infallible. When your pastor opposes Greek life, seek understanding first. Ask questions. Share resources. But also recognize that faithful believers can disagree on secondary issues while remaining in fellowship.",
    reflection: [
      "How has your church leadership responded to Greek involvement?",
      "What's the difference between submitting to spiritual authority and blindly following human opinion?",
      "How can you engage your pastor in productive conversation?"

    theme: "Finding Truth in the Noise",
    scripture: "Proverbs 14:15",
    scriptureText: "The simple believe anything, but the prudent give thought to their steps.",
    reading: "Social media amplifies the loudest voices, not necessarily the wisest ones. Viral denouncement videos often lack nuance, context, and careful biblical exegesis. Learning to evaluate content critically—rather than emotionally—is essential for peace.",
    reflection: [
      "How has social media affected your perspective on Greek life and faith?",
      "What makes a source trustworthy when evaluating spiritual claims?",
      "How can you consume content more wisely?"

    theme: "What Symbols Really Mean",
    scripture: "1 Corinthians 10:25-26",
    scriptureText: "Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, for, 'The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.'",
    reading: "Symbols mean what we make them mean. A wedding ring's origin in ancient pagan cultures doesn't make modern marriages pagan. Similarly, organizational symbols and traditions take on the meaning we assign them. The key question is: what does it mean to YOU?",
    reflection: [
      "What symbols in your organization concern critics?",
      "What do those symbols mean to you personally?",
      "How would you explain the difference between origin and current meaning?"

    theme: "Participation Without Compromise",
    scripture: "1 Corinthians 10:31",
    scriptureText: "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.",
    reading: "Every organization has rituals—churches included. The question isn't whether rituals exist, but whether they violate Scripture or conscience. Christians can participate in organizational ceremonies while maintaining their allegiance to Christ alone. Awareness and intentionality are key.",
    reflection: [
      "What rituals or ceremonies does your organization practice?",
      "Do any of these require you to compromise your faith?",

    theme: "Salt and Light in Greek Life",
    scripture: "Matthew 5:13-16",
    scriptureText: "You are the salt of the earth... You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.",
    reading: "Rather than asking 'Should I leave Greek life?', consider asking 'How can I be salt and light within it?' Your presence as a committed Christian in your organization is an opportunity for witness, service, and Kingdom impact.",
    reflection: [

    theme: "Wisdom in Participation",
    scripture: "1 Corinthians 6:12",
    scriptureText: "'I have the right to do anything,' you say—but not everything is beneficial. 'I have the right to do anything'—but I will not be mastered by anything.",
    reading: "Freedom in Christ doesn't mean reckless participation. There may be specific activities, events, or aspects of Greek life that require boundaries. Wisdom discerns the difference between acceptable and unacceptable without throwing away the whole.",
    reflection: [
      "Are there any aspects of Greek life where you've set personal boundaries?",
